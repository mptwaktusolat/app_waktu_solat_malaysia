  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/qibla/
    - assets/3d/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/OFL.txt
    - assets/json/
  #   - assets/grouped.json
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    # Adding custom icon guide: https://github.com/mptwaktusolat/app_waktu_solat_malaysia/wiki/Custom-Icons
    - family: MyMptIcons
      fonts:
